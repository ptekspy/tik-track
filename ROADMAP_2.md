# Tik-Track SaaS Roadmap — Next 10 Features (Updated, High-Priority)

This roadmap assumes the **core insight loop already works**  
(snapshots → signals → patterns → reflection).

This update elevates **notifications (PWA-compatible)** to **high priority**, because they directly increase *habit formation* and *daily usefulness*.

---

## Phase 5 — Control & optimisation (HIGH PRIORITY)

### 11. Snapshot reminders (PWA + email) ⭐️ HIGH PRIORITY
Notify creators when snapshot windows open or are about to close.

Supported channels:
- ✅ PWA push notifications (Android, desktop, iOS **installed PWAs only**)
- ✅ Email fallback (always available)

Examples:
- “1h snapshot window is open for *Video X*”
- “Last chance to record 6h snapshot for *Video Y*”

Design principles:
- Opt-in only
- Trigger permission from a clear user action (“Enable reminders”)
- Never block usage if push isn’t available

This feature directly drives **daily return usage**.

---

### 12. Posting window analysis
Track post time vs performance:

- Avg engagement by hour of day
- Completion rate by posting window

Insight example:
> “Videos posted 7–9am outperform evenings for you.”

Personal data only — no global claims.

---

### 13. Length optimisation insights
Aggregate performance by video length bands:

- <10s
- 10–15s
- 15–30s
- 30s+

Surface insights like:
> “Your best-performing videos are 8–12s.”

---

## Phase 6 — Strategic learning

### 14. Personal baseline calibration
Automatically compute creator-specific baselines:

- Typical engagement
- Typical completion
- Typical decay curve

Use baselines everywhere instead of raw numbers.

This makes analytics feel **context-aware**, not generic.

---

### 15. Content experiments
Let users explicitly define experiments:

- “Question hook vs statement hook”
- “Face cam vs screen recording”

Track outcomes intentionally.
Turns content into **controlled learning**, not guesswork.

---

### 16. Hook effectiveness scoring
Use early snapshots (1h / 3h) to rate hooks:

- Strong hook
- Average hook
- Weak hook

Based on:
- early completion
- early share rate

---

## Phase 7 — Narrative & memory

### 17. Video lifecycle timeline
Unified per-video timeline:

- Posted
- Snapshots recorded
- Signals triggered
- Notes added

Shows *why* performance evolved, not just numbers.

---

### 18. Personal content playbooks
Auto-surface learned rules over time:

- “Short opinions outperform tips”
- “Avoid hashtags X and Y”
- “Post before 9am”

Derived from accumulated metrics + post-mortems.

---

## Phase 8 — Professional use & sharing

### 19. Read-only share links
Share individual videos or summaries:

- No editing
- No dashboards
- Clean narrative layout

Perfect for coaching, reviews, or accountability.

---

### 20. Coaching / client mode
Light multi-profile support:

- Switch between creator profiles
- Isolated data
- Shared methodology

Targets consultants and serious creators without full team complexity.

---

## Guardrails (still enforced)

- No auto-scraping
- No follower chasing
- No vanity metrics
- No global benchmarks unless optional

Tik-Track remains:
**calm, intentional, opinionated analytics**.
